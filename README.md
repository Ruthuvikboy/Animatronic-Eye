# Animatronic-Eye

# Introduction
This project focuses on the development of an animatronic eye using a combination of mechanical, electrical, and programming components. The animatronic eye aims to replicate natural eye movements and expressions in a life-like manner.

# The essential components for this project include:
•	Microcontroller (Arduino)
•	Servo motors
•	Webcam 
•	Wires and connectors
•	3D-printed eye structure
•	Power supply


# Circuit Design
The microcontroller is connected to the servo motors, to control the movement and lighting of the animatronic eye. A suitable power supply ensures that the components receive adequate power.


 

# Mechanical Structure
The 3D-printed eye structure consists of the outer eye casing, eyelids, and the eye itself. The servo motors are attached to the eyelids to control blinking and movement, providing a realistic eye appearance.

 

# Code
The code for this project involves programming the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) to control the movement of the servo motors and the LED lights based on the input from the potentiometers.


# Usage
To use the animatronic eye, power on the circuit and interact with the potentiometers to control eyelid movement and eyeball rotation. Observe the realistic eye movements generated by the servo motors.

Security as it can be used as hidden camera’s helping in maintain a safe environment.

# UNSDG Goals
 
11.1 By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.

11.2 By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons.

16 - Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels

# Camera

Detects body and faces to start recording a video which saves in the same file as the code. This help user to see and verify activities in the particular area. 






#Future Improvements
Adding a camera inside the eye rather than outside .
